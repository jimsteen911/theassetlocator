## Overview
The Asset Locator is a professional public-record asset recovery service designed to help individuals, families, and organizations reclaim **unclaimed property** that rightfully belongs to them. Many people are unaware that state treasuries, courts, and institutions hold dormant funds and assets — often from forgotten bank accounts, insurance payouts, bonds, deposits, or estates.

Our mission is to make recovery simple, transparent, and compliant, while emphasizing speed and respect for every client.
